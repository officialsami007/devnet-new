# Devnet Limited — Premium Website Redesign
Concept redesign of devnetlimited.com · prepared July 2026

## Quick start
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (App Router, TypeScript) project.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # production build
npm start        # serve the production build
```

Fonts (Archivo, Inter, IBM Plex Mono) are self-hosted at build time via `next/font/google`, and GSAP + ScrollTrigger are bundled as npm dependencies — so the site needs no runtime CDN access.

## Folder structure

## Design system
| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Ink | `#05110b` | Dark canvas, footer, text on light |
| Ink-2 | `#0b1f14` | DocuDEX section background |
| Paper | `#fbfdfb` | Light section background |
| Brand green | `#16a34a` | Accents, gradients |
| Deep green | `#0e7a36` | Buttons on light, links |
| Hot green | `#2ee86c` | Accents on dark, highlights |
| Red accent | `#e5484d` | Logo dot only (heritage nod) |

Typography: **Archivo** for display headings (700/800, tight tracking), **Inter** for body/UI, **IBM Plex Mono** for micro-labels and eyebrows.

## Behaviour notes for developers
- **Background videos** (`.hero-img`, `.band-img`): `<video autoplay muted loop playsinline>` with a poster. A small script at the bottom of `index.html` tries `video.play()`; if playback is rejected (strict autoplay policies, sandboxed embeds) or no data arrives within ~2.6s, it swaps the element for the animated `.webp` fallback so the motion always shows. Users with `prefers-reduced-motion` get the static poster instead. On a normal production domain the MP4s will simply play — keep them as the primary format.
- **Animations**: GSAP ScrollTrigger drives line-mask heading reveals, card reveals, counters, parallax and the CTA underline draw. Everything degrades gracefully without JS, and `prefers-reduced-motion` disables animation.
- **Counters**: `data-count` attributes on `.count` spans (70 → "70" + unit em suffix in markup).
- **Nav**: transparent over hero → dark glass after 40px scroll; hides on scroll-down, returns on scroll-up. Mobile menu is a full-screen overlay.
- **All content** (stats, milestones, testimonials, partners, contact details) was taken from the live devnetlimited.com — verify figures before production launch.
